Praise follows accomplishment, but its deeper function is access — to vulnerability, to safety, to opportunity. The generation before us lived in a world with little room for error. They did more with less and worked twice as hard for half as much.\n\nThe internalized response to this inequity became perfectionism. Excellence turned into a defense and eventually, a justification disguised as expression.\n\nIn Gattaca, perfection is encoded into the body itself. Many of us learned a subtler version of that logic: being enough equals doing the most.\n\nThis is the false contract of safety.

You respond to life instead of interpreting life as a threat.
