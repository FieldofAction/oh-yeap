# Field of Action — Design System & Tone Form

Fill this out however feels right. Short answers, long answers, single words, references, links, screenshots — all valid. Skip anything that doesn't resonate. The goal is to surface what the site *wants to feel like*, not to fill in blanks.

---

## 1. TONE & ATMOSPHERE

**1a.** If someone landed on this site for 5 seconds and left, what single feeling should they carry away? I have a clear idea that the writing shows intelligence and the practice show impact with optimism 

>

**1b.** What 3–5 adjectives describe the emotional register? (e.g., warm but precise / restrained but alive / heavy but luminous) relaxed and alive

>

**1c.** What should the site *not* feel like? What tonal territory do you want to avoid? show without being performative

>

**1d.** Is there a time of day, season, or physical environment that matches the energy? (e.g., "early morning before anyone's awake" / "a library in winter" / "the hour after a rainstorm") Golden hour, early spring or fall, It’s the hour before culture begins

## 2. VISUAL LANGUAGE

**2a.** Color direction — pick one or describe your own:
- [+] Light, airy, near-white with subtle accent moments
- [ ] Warm earth tones — clay, sand, fog, ochre
- [+] Dark, editorial — deep backgrounds with bright type
- [ ] High contrast — black/white with one signal color
- [ ] Something else:

>

**2b.** If you had to pick 1–2 accent colors that carry meaning, what would they be and why?
#2F5BFF → tuned slightly deeper 
feels most aligned to Relational Design + governance + applied systems thinking.


>

**2c.** Typography feel — pick one or describe your own:
- [ ] Monospaced / technical — like reading source code or a terminal
- [ ] Serif / literary — like a well-set book or journal
- [ ] Sans-serif / clean — like a contemporary gallery wall text
- [ ] Mixed — display serif for headings, clean sans for body
- [ ] Something else: Neo-Grotesk / Modernist Sans

>

**2d.** How much visual density do you want? (1 = lots of whitespace, minimal / 10 = information-rich, layered)
→ 6.5 – 7
Information-present.
Layered.
But disciplined.
>

## 3. IMAGERY & MEDIA

**3a.** What role should images play?
- [ ] Hero moments — large, immersive, cinematic
- [ ] Textural — background grain, subtle pattern, atmosphere
- [ ] Documentary — real work, process shots, artifacts
- [ ] Abstract — generative, diagrammatic, systemic
- [ ] Minimal — the typography and structure *are* the visual
Prmiary : Minimal — the typography and structure are the visual
Secondary : Abstract — generative, diagrammatic, systemic
Tertiary (Selective Use) :Documentary — real work, process shots, artifacts

>

**3b.** Do you have (or want to create) any of these?
- [ ] Project case study images / screenshots
- [ ] Process photos (sketches, whiteboards, notebooks)
- [ ] Portraits or environmental photos of you
- [ ] Abstract/generative visuals
- [ ] Video (project walkthroughs, talks, ambient)
- [ ] Audio beyond what's already seeded
☑ Project case study images / screenshots
Yes. Essential.
But:
Cropped.
Structured.
Framed within analysis.
Presented as evidence, not celebration.
These are your proof of system performance.
They say:
“I have done this at scale.”
☑ Abstract / generative visuals
Yes. This is your edge.
But they must be:
Diagrammatic
Systemic
Parameter-driven
Tied to Relational Design / governance / automation
These visuals are not aesthetic experiments.
They are models made visible.
This is where your differentiation lives.
☑ Video (selectively)
But not hype reels.
Instead:
3–5 minute system walkthroughs
Calm explanation of thinking
Screen-recorded overlays
Annotated breakdowns
Low production.
High clarity.
Video becomes:
Extended listening session.
What Should Be Controlled or Limited
◻ Process photos (sketches, whiteboards)
Only if:
They support a system narrative.
Otherwise they read:
Creative director nostalgia.
You’re no longer building mystique.
You’re building architecture.
>

**3c.** Is there an image — real or imagined — that captures what this site should feel like? Describe it or paste a link.
: for example : hi-fi bar at the 1970 expo right before it opens to the public

## 4. MOTION & INTERACTION

**4a.** How should the site move? Pick a spectrum:
- Stillness ◻◻◻◻◻ Kinetic
- Where on that line?
Spectrum:
Stillness ◻◻◼◼◼◻◻ Kinetic
→ 4 / 10
Low movement.
Measured movement.
Intentional movement.

The Correct Movement Energy
Think:
A volume knob turning slowly.
A waveform pulsing subtly.
A fade, not a slide.
A 120–200ms micro transition.
No bounce.
No elastic easing.
Movement should feel like:
Air shifting in a tuned room.

Motion Principles
1. Fade > Slide
Opacity transitions.
Soft reveal.
Low acceleration curves.
2. Vertical drift < 8px
Micro movement only.
No large parallax.
3. No autoplay chaos
No carousels.
No spinning graphics.
No looping decorative animation.
4. Systemic motion only
If something moves, it’s because:
State changed
Layer shifted
Hierarchy clarified
Never for flair.
>

**4b.** What kind of interactions feel right?
- [ ] Hover reveals — content that unfolds on attention
- [ ] Scroll-driven — sections that transform as you move through
- [ ] Ambient — slow background movement, breathing textures
- [ ] Minimal — transitions only, no decorative motion
- [ ] Something else:

☑ Hover reveals — content that unfolds on attention
Primary
This fits the listening-bar metaphor perfectly.
You lean in → detail appears.
You hover → metadata fades in.
You focus → depth reveals.
This is controlled intelligence.
Not:
“Click me!”
But:
“If you look closer, I’ll show you.”
This reinforces:
Applied systems thinking
Precision
Quiet confidence
☑ Minimal — transitions only, no decorative motion
Structural baseline
Everything should:
Fade
Shift slightly
Reveal cleanly
No bounce.
No sliding panels flying in.
No animation for personality.
The system responds. It does not perform.
☑ Scroll-driven (but restrained)
Selective
Use only for:
Diagram evolution
Case study breakdown
Before/after transitions
System layer reveals
Scroll should feel like:
You are walking deeper into the pavilion.
Not:
Sections exploding into existence.
Think:
Opacity shift.
Layer alignment.
Subtle diagram expansion.
◻ Ambient movement
Avoid as a core layer.
Slow breathing textures can easily:
Dilute authority
Feel trendy
Introduce unnecessary vibe
If ambient exists, it must be:
So subtle most people don’t consciously notice.


You approach → it responds.
You move → the system adjusts.
Nothing performs on its own.

The Interaction Philosophy
Attention unlocks depth.

f I Reduce It to One Image:
You hover over a system diagram.
Lines brighten.
A node activates.
A small cobalt indicator glows.
A caption fades in.
Nothing dramatic.
But you feel the intelligence.

>

**4c.** The custom cursor, the network graph, the 3D gallery — which of these feel aligned and which feel like they belong to a different site?

Custom Cursor	❌ No	Too expressive, interface-forward
Network Graph	⚠️ Conditional	Must be structural, not decorative
3D Gallery	❌ No	Too immersive, too performative
What Does Feel Aligned Instead?
Instead of:
Custom cursor → Use micro-state changes
Network wallpaper → Use diagram modules
3D gallery → Use structured case study progression
Think:
Layered diagram reveal
Scroll-evolving system map
Controlled interactive model
Not:
Immersive playground.

## 5. CONTENT & STRUCTURE

**5a.** The hero text says "Applied awareness in live systems." Does that still feel like the right frame? If not, what's closer? doesnt feels right anymore maybe closer to this Designing Structure for Living Systems.

>

**5b.** The bio paragraph — does it need rewriting? What's missing or what feels forced?

>

**5c.** The four Work sections (Practice, Writing, Exploration, Artifacts) — do these categories still make sense? Would you rename, merge, or split any of them?

>

**5d.** What's the most important thing someone should be able to do on this site? (Read the writing? See the work? Understand your perspective? Contact you? Something else?)

>The Real Primary Action
Someone should be able to:
Grasp your system model quickly.
See proof that it works.
Feel calm authority.
Know exactly where you fit inside their organization.
If they leave thinking:
“This is the person I want inside a complex environment.”
The site worked.
So structurally, the site’s job is:
Reveal the model
Demonstrate the application
Make engagement obvious
In that order.
The Most Important Thing, Stated Clearly
They should understand your approach to complexity in under 3 minutes.
If that happens, everything else follows.
Writing deepens.
Case studies prove.
Contact becomes natural.

## 6. REFERENCES & INSPIRATIONS

**6a.** List 1–5 sites, books, albums, films, spaces, or objects that have the energy you're after. Don't explain why unless you want to. gattica, interstellar, paul smith books, the whitney & guggenhiem 

>

**6b.** Is there a designer, artist, writer, or thinker whose presentation of their own work you admire? glen o'brien, michael cina https://ghostly.com/products/michael-cina-a-century-of-artifice, kanye west stadium production

>

**6c.** Anything else — a lyric, a quote, a screenshot, a color, a texture, a memory — that feels relevant to what this site should become? 
an archway to another room that's very spacious

> push gently into the universe

---

## 7. WHAT'S BLOCKING THE FEELING

**7a.** When you look at the site right now, what specifically feels off or uninspired? Be as honest and granular as you want. 
color palatte feels slightly dated, feels like a container but I think the the image content is missing 

>

**7b.** Is the structure (grid, nav, sections) getting in the way of the content — or is the content not yet meeting the structure? the latter content not yet meeting the structure

>

**7c.** What would make you want to spend time on this site — as its creator? writing an design work https://2x4.org
